# Cost-Optimized Customer Churn Prediction System

## Overview

This project implements an **end-to-end machine learning system** to predict customer churn and optimize the prediction threshold based on **business cost**.

Traditional churn models use a default probability threshold of **0.5** to classify customers. However, in real business scenarios, the cost of misclassification is not equal.

This system identifies the **optimal threshold** that minimizes business loss by considering:

* False Negative cost (missing a churn customer)
* False Positive cost (wrongly flagging a loyal customer)

The trained model is deployed as a **FastAPI REST API** and hosted publicly so predictions can be accessed via HTTP requests.

# Problem Statement

Customer churn prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to stop using their service.

However, prediction errors have different business consequences:

| Prediction Type | Impact                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| False Negative  | Losing a customer without intervention      |
| False Positive  | Offering retention incentives unnecessarily |

Since losing a customer is more expensive, this project optimizes the prediction threshold using **cost-based evaluation** instead of a fixed threshold.

Example business cost:

* False Negative Cost = 5000
* False Positive Cost = 500

The model selects the threshold that minimizes total expected cost.

# Machine Learning Pipeline

The system follows a structured ML pipeline:

1. Data preprocessing
2. Feature engineering
3. Model training
4. Model evaluation
5. Cost-based threshold optimization
6. Deployment through FastAPI

---

# Models Used

The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest

Model selection was performed using metrics such as:

* ROC-AUC
* Precision-Recall performance
* Business cost optimization

The final model and threshold are stored as serialized artifacts.

---

# Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* FastAPI
* Uvicorn
* Git & GitHub
* Render (Cloud Deployment)

# API Usage

## Endpoint

POST `/predict`

## Request Example

```json
{
 "gender": "Female",
 "SeniorCitizen": 0,
 "Partner": "Yes",
 "Dependents": "No",
 "tenure": 5,
 "PhoneService": "Yes",
 "MultipleLines": "No",
 "InternetService": "DSL",
 "OnlineSecurity": "No",
 "OnlineBackup": "Yes",
 "DeviceProtection": "No",
 "TechSupport": "No",
 "StreamingTV": "No",
 "StreamingMovies": "No",
 "Contract": "Month-to-month",
 "PaperlessBilling": "Yes",
 "PaymentMethod": "Electronic check",
 "MonthlyCharges": 75.2,
 "TotalCharges": 350.5
}
```

## Response Example

```json
{
 "churn_probability": 0.62,
 "threshold_used": 0.147,
 "prediction": 1
}
```

Where:

* `churn_probability` → likelihood of customer churn
* `threshold_used` → optimized decision threshold
* `prediction` → final churn classification (0 or 1)
